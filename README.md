Analysis of AirBnB data from Seattle

Libraries used: 
Pandas 
Numpy
Sklearn 
Seaborn 
Matplotlib

This project was part of an assignment in Udacity's Nanodegree program in Data Science. My objective has been to
analyse the prices of listings in different neighbourhoods of Seattle using visualizations, and to perform 
regression analysis using machine learning to predict the price (independent variable) given a selected set of 
features (dependent variables).
