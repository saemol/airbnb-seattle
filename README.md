#Analysis of AirBnB data from Seattle

This project was part of an assignment in Udacity's Nanodegree program in Data Science. My objective has been to
analyse the prices of listings in different neighbourhoods of Seattle using visualizations, and to perform 
regression analysis using machine learning to predict the price (independent variable) given a selected set of 
features (dependent variables).


##Installation

Python 3 and Anaconda.
XGBoost: conda install -c anaconda py-xgboost

### Project Motivation

Using AirBnB data from Seattle to answer the following questions:

* 1. What are the prices and how many listings are there for different parts of Seattle?

* 2. Let's say a person wants the cheapest price per bed in Seattle, what is there to choose from? 

* 3. How well can we predict the price using features from the data
